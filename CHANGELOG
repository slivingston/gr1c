gr1c (0.13.1)

  * Report for citation in research, https://doi.org/10.7907/5m62h-a4204

  * Updates to documentation and dependency URLs; releases now on GitHub

 -- Scott C. Livingston <slivingston@cds.caltech.edu>  Sun, 17 Mar 2024 16:02:55 -0700


gr1c (0.13.0)

  * Initial support for Windows. This has not been thoroughly tested yet.
    However, the test suite with unmodified Bash shell scripts can be executed
    with Cygwin (https://cygwin.com/).

  * More tests, better documentation.

  * Fix bug: case when entire automaton deleted by aut_prune_deadends().
    Cf. commits 1ad9e0ede46f1187a809f82544a74d3f685b9b7f, 48465d21286ce5e8951317dea0aaaf36a395bd0b

  * Remove previously deprecated tulip0_aut_dump() and build_anode_trans()

gr1c (0.12.0)

  * Introduction of specification_t (This change occurred as part of 0.11.0.)

  * Create command-line option to redirect LTL formula for Spin Promela. Now it
    is much easier to generate and use Spin Promela models, as demonstrated in
    tests/test-verification.sh

  * Minor optimizations for special cases; these should not affect final output

  * Small improvements to the documentation, including a new section about
    static and dynamic analysis for hacking on the gr1c code

  * Include yet more details with `-vv` (verbose level >= 2)

  * Declare C99 as the standard reference. Previously it was C90 (`gcc -ansi`).

  * Create Dockerfile and Vagrantfile for gr1c

  * Consolidate Make targets. Now in most cases, `make && make check` is enough.

  * Fix several non-critical memory leaks

  * More tests

gr1c (0.11.0)

  * Begin to use CUDD 3.0.0.

  * Various updates, additions to documentation. The gr1c repository and issue
    tracker are now located at https://github.com/tulip-control/gr1c

  * Move autman to be the command `gr1c autman`, and include it among programs
    installed during `make install`.

  * Various improvements to parsing of command-line options: `-vv` is equivalent
    to `-v -v`; report unknown options that begin with `--`; add --version

 -- Scott C. Livingston <slivingston@cds.caltech.edu>  Sun, 24 Jul 2016 10:19:56 -0400


gr1c (0.10.2)

  * Include PID in default logging file name prefix.

  * Support `make -j N` for N > 1 (concurrent jobs in Make).

  * Various improvements to parsing of command-line options: `-vv` is equivalent
    to `-v -v`; report unknown options that begin with `--`; add --version

 -- Scott C. Livingston <slivingston@cds.caltech.edu>  Sun, 27 Dec 2015 23:26:22 -0800


gr1c (0.10.1)

  * Provide more varied and consistent usage of exit codes.
    (This change occurred as part of 0.10.0.)

  * The file format version switch (-s) of `autman` causes the version number to
    be printed to stdout and return of 0 (success), instead of returning the
    version number as the exit code. (This change occurred as part of 0.10.0.)

  * Default to CUDD 2.5.1

  * Decide BDD constant value from Cudd_Eval() using Cudd_IsComplement(). This
    only concerns internal usage of CUDD by gr1c.

  * Various plugs of memory leaks. These did not affect correctness of output.

gr1c (0.10.0)

  * Stop permitting letters [\]^` after first letter in variable names. This was
    an unintended and undocumented feature of the input syntax.

  * Move programs rg and grpatch to `gr1c rg` and `gr1c patch`, respectively.
    The sub-command-oriented style thus begins in the gr1c suite.

  * Create shell script get-deps.sh to automate fetching CUDD.

  * Offer command-line argument -- to stop reading options.

  * Allow for non-reentrant parser. This improves standard lex,yacc conformance.
    However, reentrant parsers may be introduced again later.

  * Refactor several functions in API to use "_to_" instead "2".

 -- Scott C. Livingston <slivingston@cds.caltech.edu>  Mon, 07 Sep 2015 09:41:31 -0700


gr1c (0.9.0)

  * Begin including a CHANGELOG, mostly following the style of Debian packages.
    Changes here are relative to the release version 0.7.4

  * The deprecated output format tulip0 is not available from the command-line
    tools.  This may break compatibility with old versions of TuLiP.

  * The default output format is now "json" rather than "tulip".  This may break
    compatibility with old versions of TuLiP.

  * Introduction of tool "autman" for working with gr1c aut files.

  * Capability to generate models in Spin Promela.

  * More documentation, including how to verify a strategy with Spin.

  * README and other plaintext files now use Markdown formatting rather than
    reStructuredText.

  * Various bugfixes, notably #14 "System liveness fails when environment has
    forced transition leading out of env liveness"
    <https://github.com/slivingston/gr1c/issues/14>.  Please consult the
    discussion on that issue page for instructions about checking whether it
    affects you.
