Python client for gr1c
======================

**gr1c** is a collection of tools for GR(1) synthesis and related activities.
Its core functionality is checking realizability of and synthesizing strategies
for GR(1) specifications, though it does much more.

This Python package wraps access to gr1c. The initial motivation is development
of an experimental service for using remote instances of gr1c via HTTP, but
other capabilities, e.g., local access to parts of the gr1c C API may be created
later. Contributions are welcome.

The version of this Python package is independent of the version of gr1c itself.
